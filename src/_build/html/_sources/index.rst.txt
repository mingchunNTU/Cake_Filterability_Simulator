Welcome to Cake_Filterability_Simulator's documentation!
==========================================================
This project estimates the filter cake resistance with specified crystal size distribution (CSD) using discrete element method and Kozeny-Carman equation.
This project is composed of two parts. First part is a LIGGGHTS template to simulate the filter cake structure with specified CSD. 
Second part are several useful python scripts that facilitate the simulation.
It's suggested that the users have some basic knowlegde of LIGGGHTS.
